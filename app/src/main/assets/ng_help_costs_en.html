<h5>Settings for cost relevant data (calls &amp; data)</h5>
<small>
<br>
Capricorn does not gather any personal data from any source of the device or from the provider.<br>
It calculates all data only by the values done in the settings and by the data provided by the device.<br>
That means for mobile and WIFI data, that the device provides data until the last system boot.<br>
For calls Capricorn reads out the data from the call log. <br>
If this will be cleared, Capricorn can not calculate data regarding calls.<br>
<br>
For a correct calculation it is necessary to make some inputs:<br>
- How shall the calculation been done<br>
-&gt; without correction<br>
-&gt; with reference value<br>
-&gt; with the billing period by your provider<br>
<br>
- Date of the next cycle change\n<br>
- Time period (monthly, 30-days, 28-days)\n<br>
- Activation of data monitoring\n<br>
<br>
- View of used or left data<br>
- High speed limit for mobile data (or personal max value if no flat)<br>
- Already used data, if the start of the measurement is within a running cycle<br>
- Activation of calls monitoring<br>
- View of used or left free minutes<br>
- Number of free minutes (or personal max value if no free minuntes or calls flat)<br>
- Already used free minutes and SMS if activated, if the start of the
measurement is within a running cycle (Used data and calls are positiv
on the widget, left data and calls are negativ on the widget).<br>
<br>
If monitoring of data and calls is activated, the widget shows the usage during the pilling period with a green dot<br>
if the usage is within a linear calculated range.<br>
Exeeds the current usage the calculated limit Capricorn shows a red dot.</small><small></small><br>
